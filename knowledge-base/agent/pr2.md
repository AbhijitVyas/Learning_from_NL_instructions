### PR2 Robot: Overview and Capabilities

The **PR2 (Personal Robot 2)** is a mobile manipulator robot developed by **Willow Garage**, first introduced in **2010**. It was designed to advance research in robotics, particularly in manipulation, perception, and human-robot interaction. The PR2 gained popularity in academia and research labs worldwide, serving as a versatile platform for exploring cutting-edge robotics.

#### Physical Specifications:
- **Arms and Hands:** 
  - The PR2 features two seven-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arms, each ending in a gripper capable of precision and power grasps. The grippers are equipped with force sensors, allowing them to handle delicate objects or exert significant force when needed.
- **Wheels and Mobility:** 
  - The robot moves using an omnidirectional base with casters, enabling smooth navigation in cluttered indoor environments.
- **Joints:**
  - It boasts a total of **48 actuated joints**, including those in its arms, torso, and head, allowing complex movements and dexterous manipulation.
- **Sensors:**
  - Equipped with a **sensor suite**, including stereo cameras, a 5-megapixel camera, a laser range finder, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), the PR2 is highly adept at mapping and navigating its environment.
- **Power Supply:**
  - It comes with a rechargeable battery system that allows it to operate autonomously for extended periods.

#### Technical Capabilities:
- **Tasks:**
  - The PR2 was designed to perform advanced tasks that require manipulation, vision, and learning. Examples include:
    - Folding towels and sorting laundry.
    - Opening doors and drawers.
    - Fetching and serving drinks.
    - Operating light switches and keyboards.
    - Pouring liquids
    - Cutting objects
  - Its highly flexible arms and grippers, combined with its robust sensor suite, enable it to handle tasks requiring fine motor skills or heavy lifting (up to 1.8 kg per arm).
- **Customizability:**
  - Researchers can program the PR2 using **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, making it a favored platform for experimenting with novel algorithms and robotics frameworks.
- **Autonomy:**
  - While PR2 can be remotely controlled, it also supports autonomous operation using advanced navigation and manipulation algorithms.

#### Limitations:
- **Tasks:**
  - At the moment PR2 can not perform picking up object from floor task

#### Legacy:
The PR2 remains a milestone in robotics history, demonstrating the potential for robots to perform intricate tasks in human environments. Though Willow Garage has since closed, its legacy continues, as the PR2's design and capabilities influenced future robot platforms, including collaborative robots for industrial and personal use.
