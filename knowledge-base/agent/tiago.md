### TIAGo Robot: Overview and Capabilities

The **TIAGo (Take It And Go)** robot is a mobile manipulator developed by **PAL Robotics**, first introduced in **2015**. Designed as a versatile platform for research, education, and real-world applications, TIAGo combines mobility and manipulation, making it ideal for tasks in service robotics, healthcare, and human-robot collaboration.

#### Physical Specifications:
- **Arms and Hands:**
  - TIAGo is available in configurations with one or two robotic arms. Each arm features **7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF)** for dexterous manipulation. The gripper at the end of the arm can handle objects of various sizes and shapes.
- **Base and Mobility:**
  - TIAGo is equipped with an omnidirectional base powered by wheels, allowing smooth and agile navigation in indoor environments, including tight spaces.
- **Joints:**
  - Depending on its configuration, TIAGo has **10 to 15+ degrees of freedom**, including its arm(s), head, torso, and base.
- **Sensors:**
  - TIAGo features a rich sensor suite, including:
    - A **RGB-D camera** for 3D perception.
    - Laser range finders for mapping and obstacle detection.
    - A microphone and speakers for audio interaction.
    - An IMU for stability and orientation awareness.
- **Adjustable Torso:**
  - TIAGo's torso can extend vertically, allowing it to reach higher objects or adapt to different task environments.

#### Technical Capabilities:
- **Tasks:**
  - TIAGo is designed to perform a variety of tasks, including:
    - Grasping and manipulating objects with precision.
    - Navigating autonomously in dynamic environments.
    - Assisting with domestic tasks like picking up objects or fetching items.
    - Acting as a service robot in healthcare or hospitality, such as delivering items or providing assistance to people.
  - Its modularity and versatility make it adaptable to complex scenarios in both research and real-world applications.
- **Customizability:**
  - Programmable through **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, TIAGo offers extensive flexibility for researchers and developers to implement and test new algorithms or robotics frameworks.
- **Collaboration:**
  - TIAGo is designed to work safely around humans, with integrated collision detection and compliance control, ensuring safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

#### Limitations:
- **Tasks:**
  - At the moment Tiago can not perform pouring task
  - At the moment Tiago can not perform cutting task
  - At the moment Tiago can not perform wiping task
  - At the moment Tiago can not perform picking up object from floor task

#### Legacy and Applications:
